To load the data, create and select a database. Run source 
load-data.sql to load the data from the FIVB dataset.
To run the python file, run python app-template.py in the
command line. Note that for this file to work, you must be connected to a 
local SQL server. Be sure to make changes depending on your individual port,
user, password, and database (titled 'volleyballdb' by default). Ensure you also have the proper 
packages installed - sys and mySQL.connector. Once it connects, follow the commands
in the command line and input prompts. Have fun!
